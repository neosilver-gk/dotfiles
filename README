Here is how you have to add this dotfiles, if you wish to use it as your settings.

first clone the repo to your user files:

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/neosilver-gk/dotfiles.git

you can also rename the direktory at cloning ex.:

git clone https://github.com/neosilver-gk/dotfiles.git .files


after that, you have to delete your .emacs.d directory and .emacs file.

rm -r .emacs.d .emacs

than your just add a link to the directory from the dotfiles

ln -s dotfiles/emacs.d .emacs.d

So that's it.

Have fun and an easy work with you settins.
