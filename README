Here is how you have to add this dotfiles, if you wish to use it as your settings.

first clone the repo to your user files:

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/neosilver-gk/dotfiles.git

you can also rename the direktory at cloning ex.:

git clone https://github.com/neosilver-gk/dotfiles.git .files


after that, you have to delete your .vimrc, .bashrc and .vim and create links to
the new one.

rm -r .vimrc .bashrc .vim

ln -s dotfiles/vimrc .vimrc
ln -s dotfiles/bashrc .bashrc
ln -s dotfiles/vim .vim

The last part is to get all submodules. Go to into dotfiles and load all submodules.

cd ~/dotfiles

git submodules init
git submodules update

So that's it.

Have fun and an easy work with you settins.
